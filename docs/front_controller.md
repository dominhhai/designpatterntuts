The front controller design pattern is used to provide a centralized request handling mechanism so that all requests will be handled by a single handler. This handler can do the authentication/ authorization/ logging or tracking of request and then pass the requests to corresponding handlers. Following are the entities of this type of design pattern.

* **Front Controller** - Single handler for all kinds of requests coming to the application (either web based/ desktop based).

* **Dispatcher** - Front Controller may use a dispatcher object which can dispatch the request to corresponding specific handler.

* **View** - Views are the object for which the requests are made.
