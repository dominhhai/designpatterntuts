Composite Entity pattern is used in EJB persistence mechanism. A Composite entity is an EJB entity bean which represents a graph of objects. When a composite entity is updated, internally dependent objects beans get updated automatically as being managed by EJB entity bean. Following are the participants in Composite Entity Bean.

* **Composite Entity** - It is primary entity bean. It can be coarse grained or can contain a coarse grained object to be used for persistence purpose.

* **Coarse-Grained Object** - This object contains dependent objects. It has its own life cycle and also manages life cycle of dependent objects.

* **Dependent Object** - Dependent object is an object which depends on coarse grained object for its persistence lifecycle.

* **Strategies** - Strategies represents how to implement a Composite Entity.
